#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. 
#If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; 
#if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; 
#and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. 
#Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

#while loop with true statment
while True:

    age=(input("Your Age: "))

   #break statement when user inputs "Done"
    if age == "Done":
        break
    
    #identifies the user input as integer
    age=int(age)
